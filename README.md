# EISPricingProject
GSA EIS prices needed to be pulled to compare rates. Had to make an automation step to skip entering over 6400 entires by hand. Made Python script to pull out needed data from file, verify CLIN and NSC's were valid and pull all associated pricing data. Data was then exported to .csv file for internal uses.
